# Daily Dashboard

This project is a daily dashboard that provides visualizations of data queried from a database. It is divided into two main parts: the front end and the back end.

## Front End

The front end is created with React.js. It provides the capability to:

- Display graphs of the queried data
- Filter items from the data
- Search for specific items
- Plot the results of the search as a graph

The main component for this functionality is the `Dashboard` component in [src/pages/Dashboard.jsx](../../../../d:/DX/Gits/daily_dashboard/front_end/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx).

## Back End

The back end is responsible for:

- Filtering processes
- Querying data from the database
- Processing the data for visualization
